## Work in Progress

This app is very much a work-in-progress and still has several rough areas and missing features (such as drag to select and save/load portfolios). Work is currently focusing on adding the main features of the app, so several UI refinements still need to be implemented.

As a result, it is quite easy to make the running app crash. For example, shift-drag and deleting all of the sketches from a Portfolio. Other features are "broadly" implemented and will behave oddly based on what the user does while running the app. For example, setting names to "" (empty string) or given **Colors** or **Gradients** the same, non-unique name.

This known issues will all be solved in the finished apps (editors are planned on all Xamarin/Windows platforms). For now the app is definitely use at your own risk!

#What's New in Kimono Designer

Kimono Designer provides several key features that make it the perfect tool for designing SkiaSharp graphics that can be used in all of your cross-platform applications. This version offers the following new and improved features:

* **Source Code Export** - Added the ability to export the source code generated for the selected item to a text file.
* **Source Code Generation** - Added the ability to emit C# code required to create any element of a portfolio (or the entire portfolio itself) that can then be included in a Xamarin based project. Select the language (C#, F#, Java, etc.), OS Platform (Mac, Android, iOS, Xamarin.Forms, etc.) and optionally be able to use the KimonoCore helper library in the emitted code.
* **Welcome Screen** - Added a "Welcome" window that displays when the app is first launched with information about what new, start a new portfolio, open an existing portfolio, etc. 
* **Added File Save & Load** - Added the ability to save and load Kimono Designer Portfolios to/from disk.
* **Tabbed UI** - Switched to a modern macOS App UI where multiple open projects will be opened or created as tabs in a single window, instead of opening multiple windows.
